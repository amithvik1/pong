SDN-Socket Programming – Jackfruit Mini Project
Goal:
The objective of this project is to design, implement, and evaluate a networked application
using low-level TCP/UDP socket programming integrated with SDN. The project should
demonstrate a clear understanding of TCP/UDP communication, concurrency, protocol
design, programmable network control, and performance evaluation within a Mininet-based
environment.
Mandatory Requirements:
•  The application must be implemented using TCP or UDP sockets as specified in the
project.
The project must include appropriate client, server, worker, broker, or peer components
•
based on the selected application.
•  The application should support multiple communicating nodes/clients wherever
applicable.
•  The application must be deployed and tested in a Mininet-based network topology.
•  The project should demonstrate interaction between the socket application and the
SDN-controlled network.
•  The complete system should run in a controlled Mininet + SDN controller + socket-
programming environment.
•  Students must provide the topology, source code, configuration, test cases, and
instructions required to reproduce the results.
Final demo code should be shared in GitHub repo with complete documentation.
